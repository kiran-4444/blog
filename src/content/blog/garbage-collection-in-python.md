## Motivation

Python uses a private heap to store objects. The heap space is managed by Python's memory manager. The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code.

## Garbage Collection

Garbage collection is the process of freeing up the memory space occupied by the objects that are no longer referenced by the program. Python's garbage collector runs during program execution and is triggered when an object's reference count reaches zero. An object's reference count changes as the number of aliases that point to it changes.

## Reference Counting

Reference counting is a simple technique that keeps track of the number of references to an object. When the reference count of an object becomes zero, the object is deallocated from the memory.

Python's memory manager uses a private heap to store objects. The heap space is managed by Python's memory manager. The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code.

## Tracing

Tracing is a technique that identifies the objects that are no longer referenced by the program. The garbage collector runs during program execution and is triggered when an object's reference count reaches zero. An object's reference count changes as the number of aliases that point to it changes.

## Generational Collection

Generational collection is a technique that divides the heap space into different generations. Objects that are created at the same time belong to the same generation. The garbage collector runs during program execution and is triggered when an object's reference count reaches zero. An object's reference count changes as the number of aliases that point to it changes.

## Weak References

Weak references are a technique that allows the programmer to create a reference to an object without increasing its reference count. The garbage collector runs during program execution and is triggered when an object's reference count reaches zero. An object's reference count changes as the number of aliases that point to it changes.

## Finalization

Finalization is a technique that allows the programmer to define a finalizer for an object. The garbage collector runs during program execution and is triggered when an object's reference count reaches zero. An object's reference count changes as the number of aliases that point to it changes.

## Debugging

Debugging is a technique that allows the programmer to debug the garbage collector. The garbage collector runs during program execution and is triggered when an object's reference count reaches zero. An object's reference count changes as the number of aliases that point to it changes.

## Performance

Performance is a technique that allows the programmer to improve the performance of the garbage collector. The garbage collector runs during program execution and is triggered when an object's reference count reaches zero. An object's reference count changes as the number of aliases that point to it changes.

## Conclusion

Python's garbage collector runs during program execution and is triggered when an object's reference count reaches zero. An object's reference count changes as the number of aliases that point to it changes.
